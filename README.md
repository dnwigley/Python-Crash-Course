# Python-Crash-Course
This is repository of my files for the book of the same name

Hello
My name is David Wigley and I am an Electrical consultant and a learner of Python.

I am frustrated that in my youth I used to do Basic on a BBC Model B and later in life I programmed a Psion series 5 todo cable calculations.

I am therefore looking to the Python language to bring me up to speed with obect orientated programming and the language to help me
automate things at work
